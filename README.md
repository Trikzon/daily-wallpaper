# Daily Wallpaper
A python script that grabs today's top r/wallpaper and sets it as your desktop wallpaper

## Usage

Run the `daily_wallpaper.py` script with python3.

Wallpapers will download into a `./wallpapers` directory next to the `daily_wallpaper.py` file.

For the best experience, run this every day (automatically) for good wallpapers each day.

## Dependencies

To install all dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
